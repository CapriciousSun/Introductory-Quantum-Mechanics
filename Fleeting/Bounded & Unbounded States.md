Classically, any state that could escape the the confines of the energy allowance and doesn't exhibit oscillatory behavior is a bounded state. Otherwise, it is unbounded. In quantum, there are serveral cases. When $E < 0$, the wavefunction is non-normalizable, since the integral for the wavefunction will blow up on at least one side of the wavefunction. So, in a typically classically bounded state, there will be exponential decay outside of the barrier, and within the barrier, if $E > K$, there will be an oscillatory wavefunction. In an classically unbounded state, there will be a scattering state before the $E < K$. The definition of a bound state are $E < V(-\infty)$ and $E < V(+\infty)$, whereas a scattering state has $E > V(-\infty)$ or $E > V(+\infty)$. 

## Parity
The wavefunction and its derivative must be continuous, so wavefunction across different potentials will be solved separately. THe spectrum fo bound states is *non-degenerate*, so there is only one distinct wavefunction for he same energy level. The parity of a wavefunction is the nodes of wavefunction. Parity symmetry is to be respect here, so solving one part of the well would help answer the other half. 

## Wavefunction
The wavefunction going to the right, when it meets a barrier of greater energy, would have reflection to the left. So the wavefunction would reflect that $\Psi(x) = Ae^{i\kappa x} + Be^{-i\kappa x}$. $\Psi(x, t) = Te^{i\kappa x}e^{-iEt/\hbar}$.
