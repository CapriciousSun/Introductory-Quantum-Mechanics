The Hilbert space is the most basic concept within quantum mechanics, as it is how quantum states are expressed in. Describing any quantum system starts by describing the Hilbert space. 
## Formalism
A Hilbert space is denoted as $\mathcal{H}$. *Any vector space with a positive definite inner product* is a Hilbert space, and when it is infinite dimensional, the space must be "complete" so that the [[Wavefunction|wavefunction]] cannot exit the space in which it is in.
